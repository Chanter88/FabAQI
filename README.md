# FabAQI

FabAQI is a Shiny application that can be used to predict the air quality values for a given day based on the values
from the previous two years' values for the date.  The application uses the daily summary values for the Air Quality Index (AQI) 
for 2013 and 2014 from the [EPA Air Quality](http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html#Daily) website for
four pollutants:  
* Carbon monoxide
* Sulfur dioxide
* Nitrogen dioxide
* Ozone
